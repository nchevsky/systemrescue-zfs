# cowpacman2srm - Create SystemRescueModules (SRM) from pacman packages installed into the COW space
#

#
# This script is meant to help creating SystemRescueModules (SRM) for SystemRescue.
# More info about SRMs and this script can be found at:
# https://www.system-rescue.org/Modules/
#
# To use first install all packages you want to have in your SRM with pacman.
# Default COW (Copy-On-Write) space is a ramdisk, so you usually don't have to do anything
# special except provide enough RAM.
# You can also enable any systemd services that are in these packages.
#
# Then call:
# cowpacman2srm [-s subcmd] [-c compalg] [-l complevel] [targetfile.srm]
#
# This script runs in two stages:
# 1) During the "prepare" stage all files belonging to pacman packages manually installed
#    are being copied to a temporary directory
# 2) During the "create" stage the SRM file (which is a squash file system) is being created
#    with the contents stored in the temporary directory
# You can either run both stages in a single run (this is the default) or one stage at a time.
# If you do not specify any sub-command the script is going to run the two stages in one run.
# If you want to customize the contents of the SRM module you can run the "prepare" stage first,
# then make customizations in the temporary directory (for example to add extra files) and then
# you run the "create" stage to produce the SRM file.
#
# Copy the .srm file to archisobasedir (default: "sysresccd") on your boot disk
# and add the "loadsrm" boot parameter to SystemRescue.
#
# There is no mechanism to check if a SRM is compatible with the version of SystemRescue
# you are trying to run it with. So it is higly recommended to only use this script on
# the exact version of SystemRescue you plan to use the SRM with.
